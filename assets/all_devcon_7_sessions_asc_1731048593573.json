        "description": "Existing VPNs are essentially scams. Free VPNs and most centralized VPNs (such as ExpressVPN, owned by Kape) are effectively data harvesting companies.  Decentralized VPNs usually have a few large servers and offer barely any more privacy than centralized VPNs. What is missing is 1) onion-routing packets like Tor 2)  adding noise (fake traffic) 3) censorship-resistance and 4) mixing packets from different users together. We'll explore how technologies work to defeat even AI adversaries.",

From that learning we are building a language and compiler, that is summarizing much of this learning.\r\nWe answer questions like: Are compilers necessary in a zkVM world? What is the role of a compiler in ZKP development?  What are its most common components? How different ways can this problem be approached?\r\nIn this advanced talk, we will learn how we compile arbitrary boolean expressions, or how the Schwartz‚ÄìZippel lemma can be used to optimize",

But they don't have to be!\r\nZK proofs are complex not because of the depth math they use, but because of the large number of fields of mathematics they leverage features from.\r\nIn this talk, we'll break down STARK proofs into simple blocks and colorful analogies so that you get a good high level overview of how they work",

        "description": "Producing high-quality developer tools for the Web3 ecosystem is a challenging task that requires significant effort (and funding). Many of the best and most used tools started out as a lone hackers side-project, and then evolved into longer-standing projects by being absorbed into a larger companies efforts. In this talk, we'll share RV's open-source tool development story, and discuss what a better future could look like.",

Current solutions face two issues: 1) increased operational costs due to batch submission overhead or 2) protocol complexity during challenges. We'll share our experience addressing these using ZK fault proof. Our new challenge system is cost-free for users and easily extendable to ZK rollups.

We will demistify the hype on how and if trusted hardware (TEEs) can help us decentralize. Let's focus on geographical diversity and permissionless designs, to bring the world together.",

When we researched risks in the past users didn't find the information relevant, because they weren't aware they were using a specific protocol.

In this talk, we describe how to extend one of the protocols from Ligero and Brakedown to the regime of batched polynomial commitments, at the cost of a single extra operation in the verifier. Similarly to Redshift, we opt for increased efficiency via the list decoding regime. We also present an optimisation for using the resulting commitment with PIOPs.",

State changes, differing contract behavior between simulation and on-chain execution, and randomness can all affect the outcome. In this talk, I'll share my experiences and learnings from simulating user transactions over the past 2 years",

This means calls into transfers on ERC20s and dexes can be made in parallel, accelerating speed drastically. It also is more secure.\r\n\r\nIt‚Äôs a forgotten mechanism to scale ETH.",

Anyone attending has the chance to find the issue and break the network!",

In most optimal approaches these curves would construct a cycle, but there are no such known cycles. Instead, we use non-native arithmetic to brute force the pairing computation at the cycle cut-off.\r\nWe describe an approach for combining direct field extension with polynomial-based non-native arithmetic. This reduces pairing computation to bivariate polynomial identity testing using Schwartz-Zippel lemma.",

Traditional modular designs, which divide machines into components and use relational arguments, face inefficiencies due to the padding of unused cells with dummy values. VADCOPs optimize performance by allowing maximum modularity and avoiding unused components, making proof generation precise and efficient without unnecessary redundancy.",

It tightly integrates with the Ethereum Execution Layer Specification (EELS) and could potentially be used across the L2 EVM ecosystem.",

        "description": "Auction mechanisms are fascinating, and so are protocol designs. When you put both together, things get really interesting. In this talk, we'll dive into various auction mechanisms and see how they shape protocol design choices. We'll cover key aspects like the timing game, MEV burn, and participant trusts. Then we will look at case studies: Ethereum, Optimism, and Arbitrum. For each case, we'll conclude how protocol impacts auction or vice versa.",

We characterize the robust security of a restaking network as a function of the buffer between the costs and profits from attacks. We also provide local analogs of these guarantees that apply specifically for a target service or coalition of services. Our results suggest measures of robustness that could be exposed to the participants in a restaking protocol. Full paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21785",

This optimisation becomes especially critical in the context of Full DAS, as data production per slot is anticipated to far exceed the current Deneb-Cancun (Dencun) specifications. The Rated List attempts to improve rate of successful sampling against unfavourable network conditions there by reducing the bandwidth consumption of the overall network.",

We search for optimal strategies for a trader that owns such advantage. To find optimal strategies, we simulate price changes on CEX using real data and assume DEX price does not change in the latency advantage interval. We find that optimal strategy can even be to trade right away as soon as the price difference crosses a threshold where trading is profitable",

That was the seed for the Hermez network where I got the role of protocol engineer. Hermez evolution was Polygon zkEVM, where I was the team lead in the protocol team where we code the EVM in a new zk language, zkASM.",

        "description": "Ethereum heavily utilizes it's strong social layer for protocol governance decisions. In recent years, we have seen projects try on chain token holder governance to make upgrades. This is a dangerous path and has proven itself to be susceptible to oligarchies and collusion. There is hope in the form of on chain token signaling with non-binding resolutions that are then executed by a trusted committee. Don't worry, I won't only be bitching about on chain governance with no solutions.",

This tendency, seen throughout history‚Äîfrom the telegraph to Ethereum‚Äîstems from what can be called ‚ÄúThe Franklin Fallacy.‚Äù When asked about the purpose of a hot air balloon, Benjamin Franklin famously responded, \"What good is a newborn baby?\" highlighting how judging a technology in its infancy is shortsighted.

        "description": "Chain abstraction has taken the front seat. As innovations continue, it's becoming increasingly stark that we will eventually approach a world where third-party solvers fulfill most transactions. The core protocol is also changing to cater to further abstractions even at the validator level. The question remains, how far are we willing to go in the name of efficiency, and optimizations, to which a user can't use Ethereum without third parties?",

How can this be customized?\r\n- What would need to go into writing a builder from the ground up?\r\n- How does one acquire orderflow? What is the relative value of various sources of orderflow?\r\n- What infrastructure is required? How much does it cost?",

        "description": "This talk presents an empirical analysis of Loss versus Rebalancing (LVR) on Arbitrum, Base and Ethereum. It compares the realised and theoretical LVR; along with the arbitrage profits from CEX-DEX/Perpetual; then further reveals whether the frequency of delta-hedging, the pool liquidity and the block time difference lead to better or worse LVR.",

It re-executes mainnet transactions using EOF bytecode instead of original bytecode, comparing results and performance with the original execution.\r\nEmilie tests interactions between EOF and legacy contracts using real data. It supports recompilation for Solidity and Vyper, enabling it to find bugs across compilers and execution clients.",

LVR remains a significant challenge for AMMs. This session delves into a comprehensive analysis of how CoW AMM addresses the problem of LVR through its unique batch mechanism. Drawing from 9 months of empirical data, the talk will explore the effectiveness of CoW AMM in mitigating LVR and offer insights into the impact of LVR resistant design on trading outcomes and market efficiency",

Implementing a smart contract-based contribution analysis framework for federated learning on a privacy-enabled Ethereum L2 can address this challenge, and build the economics of federated learning public chain.",

This talk will tell you how to simulate an Ethereum network with 100+ nodes on a laptop-sized machine with production Ethereum clients.",

When 2/3 of the validator set are online and agree, we finalize. Otherwise, we enter a period of non-finality which can be very long, up to a few weeks. Long non-finality has never happened in Ethereum's history and could trigger a cascade of failures that will kill liveness. How can we harden the network against this? How high are the stakes?",

PODs allow arbitrary key/value data to be signed and distributed.  Flexible proofs about PODs can be created using a highly-configurable family of General Purpose Circuits (GPCs), without app-specific circuits or trusted setup.  This talk will focus on POD and GPC motivation and design.",

We developed a time-series-based fuzz testing tool for the Ethereum network layer. In this tool, we integrated mutation mechanisms and seed selection algorithms, and introduced a new time-series feedback model. Using this tool, we can spot and fix existing vulnerabilities while also spotting new risks.",

At the current stage we have ended up at around 13,000 fork choice tests, but the test suite we developed allows to generate a million of tests and even more.",

We'll cover why state is contentious, what state is contentious, what can be accomplished by making state non-contentitious, and strategies for refactoring existing systems to reduce contention.",

It's important for us to remember that it's normal to sometimes feel like an impostor, not yet in the right place or that everyone else has their shit together. What matters more is how we deal with it, find the courage to form real connections, be kind to each other and ourselves.\r\nHere some frameworks and helpful personal insights to deal with this and truly enjoy the rollercoaster journey.",

Many layer-2s are of the same mentality of copy and pasting their architecture and have not innovated over key blockchain problems such as parallel execution or state growth. If Ethereum is to compete with other alternative high performance blockchains, it has to solve for state growth. This talk will explore the landscape of state minimized layer-2s and show how Ethereum will be able to go beyond the state problem with non-EVM based design.",

Its primary application is to accelerate fuzzing by testing transactions in multiple sandbox EVMs on GPUs. Additionally, we have integrated it into Goevmlab to support a broader range of use cases. We will discuss the design choices, challenges, results, and future plans to leverage CuEVM beyond fuzzing.",

We'll start by introducing the problem that discovery tries to solve and after that we'll get into trying to understand the architecture of a real world project by using the avenues this tool gives us. After this session the participant should feel empowered to use discovery to deepen his knowledge about all on-chain deployments.",

Currently, it is discussed as a potential blocker for several prominent mechanism designs. We analyzed two years of MEV boost data covering more than 5 million slots to investigate historical patterns of it. Amongst other findings we see less multi-slot sequences occur than randomly feasible however that payments for longer sequences are higher than average.",

When it comes to developing the Ethereum CL, the community follows two pragmatic approaches: Writing pen & paper proofs and writing executable specs in Python. We show how model checking can confirm our intuition about the behavior of consensus protocols or disprove it. We do so by applying our method to one of the recently proposed Single Slot Finality protocols",

        "description": "MEV is problematic today. The MEV supply chain puts centralizing pressure on Ethereum. There‚Äôs also an allocation problem; proposers (not apps or users) earn nearly all MEV, though they‚Äôre merely protocol agents. Numerous proposed solutions address this (ePBS, EAs, ETs, FOCIL, BRAID...), each with tradeoffs and assumptions about whether MEV is intrinsic to blockchains or extrinsic & preventable. Research is challenging to enter w/o continuous engagement. I‚Äôll provide an overview of the research.",

RIP-7755 changes the game by trustlessly bridging the gap between L2 chains, allowing new use cases that rely solely on Ethereum and its rollups. In this workshop, we‚Äôll explore RIP-7755 by building a cross-chain NFT minting app, focusing on nested storage proof implementation details to eliminate trust assumptions.",

This leaves systems vulnerable if better attacks emerge. We propose guidelines for achieving 100 bits of provable security and a method for parameter tuning, aiming to enhance SNARK security in L2s+blockchains.",

As we seek to extract more from digital services, we are giving them more and more of our personal data.\r\n\r\nBut it doesn't have to be this way. Just as we gained self-sovereignty and ownership over our digital assets and money, we can achieve the same for our digital identities and data using similar and new technologies.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will explain what self-sovereign identity is, why we need it, and where we stand today.",

Neither assumption has served us well and the time has come for legal certainty. This talk is about how we get there.",

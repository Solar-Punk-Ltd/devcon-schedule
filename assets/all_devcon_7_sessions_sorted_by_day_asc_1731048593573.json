Enter state expiry – a compelling answer to our growing state problem. In this talk, I'll dive into the analysis of Ethereum's state growth problem down to the key-value pair level, the evolution of state expiry proposals, and the latest research on Ethereum's state expiry solutions.",

      "description": "Can contracts across rollups interact synchronously while maintaining horizontal scalability? The L2 interoperability problem can be viewed through the lens of collaborative SNARKs, where a coordinator splits a witness over N provers who collectively generate a proof, and the work each prover does should decrease linearly in N (horizonal scaling). This talk presents a solution for the special case of L2 interoperability and motivates new design constraints for SNARKs.",

It tightly integrates with the Ethereum Execution Layer Specification (EELS) and could potentially be used across the L2 EVM ecosystem.",

In a p2p network, it can be used to limit messages sent over a period of time by one sender. RLN’s latest upgrade limits to N (instead of 1) messages per epoch. Also, the Merkle tree is now built on-chain, greatly improving the UX.\r\n\r\nCome learn how to use an implementation of RLNv2 to DoS protect a peer-to-peer network.",

How much liquidity?\r\n\r\nBut in a possible future where Ethereum applications extend beyond finance, into areas like autonomous worlds, games, and social, what does scaling look like and what challenges await?\r\n\r\nJoin us as we explore challenges, solutions, and open questions in this space—how do we bring latency down despite seconds-long block time? Could we shard an app across multiple chains?",

This tendency, seen throughout history—from the telegraph to Ethereum—stems from what can be called “The Franklin Fallacy.” When asked about the purpose of a hot air balloon, Benjamin Franklin famously responded, \"What good is a newborn baby?\" highlighting how judging a technology in its infancy is shortsighted.

In contrast, Web3 lacks profiles, leaving dApps unable to understand user needs resulting in low retention rates. Despite onboarding efforts, 88% of wallets created through account abstraction last year were used less than five times. Perhaps tying user interests and reputation to wallets by creating profiles is the secret sauce for mass web3 adoption",

In this talk, we’ll confront embarrassing truths: drainer attacks, weak wallet protections, and overlooked vulnerabilities. But we won’t stop there; I’ll share practical fixes to protect users and show how Web3 developers can raise the bar. If we want Web3 to thrive, we have to stop attackers beating us with low-effort attacks. We can do better!",

But long-term they will be responsible for the management and maintenance of their chains from all perspectives - ecosystem growth, software development, security, chain economic parameters management, and others. In this talk, I will explore what DAOs need to figure out and fix before they will be able to take this responsibility in the coming years and why we should be addressing those issues already today.",

When it comes to developing the Ethereum CL, the community follows two pragmatic approaches: Writing pen & paper proofs and writing executable specs in Python. We show how model checking can confirm our intuition about the behavior of consensus protocols or disprove it. We do so by applying our method to one of the recently proposed Single Slot Finality protocols",

The Pessimistic proof is a proof generated to securely grant this shared liquidity, and it will be technically explained in this flash talk by one of the developers.",
